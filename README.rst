About
-----

Erizo is a Python package for interpolation (*gridding*) of multi-component
ground displacement measurements (from GPS/GNSS or InSAR, for example).
It uses an elastic Green's functions approach for interpolation based on
`Verde <https://www.fatiando.org/verde>`__.


Project goals
-------------

* 2- and 3-component velocity/displacement interpolation.
* Use simple elastic Green's functions.
* Include cross-validated versions of all interpolation classes.
* Scale to moderately sized datasets (without requiring 100s Gb of RAM) using
  numba and dask.
* Provide an interface similar to scikit-learn for machine learning style
  interpolation.


Contacting Us
-------------

Imposter syndrome disclaimer
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**We want your help.** No, really.

There may be a little voice inside your head that is telling you that you're
not ready to be an open source contributor; that your skills aren't nearly good
enough to contribute.
What could you possibly offer?

We assure you that the little voice in your head is wrong.

**Being a contributor doesn't just mean writing code**.
Equally important contributions include:
writing or proof-reading documentation, suggesting or implementing tests, or
even giving feedback about the project (including giving feedback about the
contribution process).
If you're coming to the project with fresh eyes, you might see the errors and
assumptions that seasoned contributors have glossed over.
If you can write any code at all, you can contribute code to open source.
We are constantly trying out new skills, making mistakes, and learning from
those mistakes.
That's how we all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
